# 🚌 Chasing a Bus

Late for work? Catch the bus before it’s too late!

Chasing a Bus is a clicker-style board/arcade game built around speed, timing, and decision-making. The player controls a running character chasing a moving bus, jumping over obstacles and collecting coins to rack up points — but beware: trash slows you down and costs you cash!

## 🎮 Game Concept

The player is late for work and must chase down the bus.

The background continuously moves to simulate running.

The bus leads the way at the front of the screen.

The player controls a running character on the left side of the screen.

## Actions:

Jump to avoid obstacles.

Collect coins to increase your score.

Avoid trash — hitting it will make you lose some cash.

🛠️ Features

🏃 Running Character: Always in motion, controlled by clicks or key presses.

🚌 Bus Leading: The goal is to catch up to the moving bus.

💰 Coin Spawner: Randomly spawns coins to collect (points++).

🗑️ Obstacles (Trash): Lose points or cash if collected.

🎵 Background Movement: Simulates urgency and speed.

📈 Score System: Collect coins, dodge trash, and chase down the bus for the high score.

## 📂 How to Play

Start the game — your character begins running automatically.

Click (or press the jump key) to leap over trash and obstacles.

Collect coins to increase your score.

Avoid trash to keep your cash.

Stay on pace and try to catch the bus before time runs out!
